{EPITECH} | First year | Elementary programming in C project

Hex is an elaborate, magic-powered and self-building computer (not unlike the ‘shamble’, a kind of
magical device used by the Witches of the Discworld) and is housed in the basement of the High Energy
Magic Building at the Unseen University (UU) in the twin city of Ankh-Morpork.

Hex is a computer unlike any other. Programmed via ‘Softlore’, Hex runs and evolves under the watchful
eyes of wizard Ponder Stibbons, who becomes the de facto IT manager at UU because he’s the only one
who understands what he’s talking about.

Hex has its origins in a device created by some student Wizards in the High Energy Magic building.
In this form it was simply a complex network of glass tubes, containing ants. The wizards could then
use punched cards to control which tubes the ants could crawl through, enabling it to perform simple
mathematical functions.

Let’s pay close attention to its calculation unit: an anthill with rooms and tunnels. A room can be connected
to an infinite number of other rooms by as many tunnels as needed, but a tunnel can only connect two
rooms.

It would be nice to build one of our own, but since we’re not really into DIY, let’s make a high-tech version:
a “Hex’ calculation unit” simulator.

See the subject for further details !

========================

Tip : 
We stuggled a lot during this project because the subject may be hard to understand, so pay close attention to what it says !!

Especially : "The first noncompliant or empty line will lead to the end of the anthill acquisition, as
well as its normal treatment with the data that has already been acquired."

keep that in mind while making your error handling :)
